entering normal forest 1;Green, green, green...There is nothing but green as far as your eyes can see. Maybe this is it? Maybe the end of the tracks is just one gigantic infinite forest? You think for a second then laugh this ridiculous idea off. No, the World Railway Company would not have built those tracks if they didn’t lead to somewhere they could turn a profit. You, of all people, should know.;;
entering normal forest 2;This forest is dark and cold, but hey, it’s still better than the Catastrophe. Nevertheless you feel like you’re not welcome. The wind whispers in the tall branches, echoes of the menace catching up to you. The sooner you’ll be out of here the better.;;
entering normal forest 3;You don’t remember ever being in a forest like this one. You are the farthest you’ve ever been from home. Nothing is familiar, not even a single tree. Maybe you should have left sooner and travel the world to discover new things? Well, to hell with regrets, you’re doing it now aren’t you?;;
entering normal forest 4;As the tall trees start to surround the tracks, you feel weirdly calm. Their warm embrace, their deep roots, their thick green leaves. It almost seems impossible for them to falter. For a second you start hoping that maybe, just maybe, they could stop the Catastrophy. But then, you come back to your senses and you remember. There is no stopping it.;;

entering normal desert 1;Even within your air conditioned cabin, you feel the warmth of the land you just reached. Here, there is nothing but sand, sun and cacti. You try to think about this positively: at least, there won’t be much for the Catastrophe to destroy in this place. Hopefully, this won’t make it go faster.;;
entering normal desert 2;Your eyes get lost in the ocean of sand you’re heading towards. You start second-guessing yourself. Maybe you should have gone another way? Then, you realize you really don’t like second-guessing yourself and you stop. This desert will not be the end. It cannot be! It would be an unfitting tomb for someone like you.;;
entering normal desert 3;As your engine starts pushing through the desert you cannot help but wonder : why? Why did the World Railway Company come all the way over here to build those tracks? Somehow, you doubt it was because they needed sand. Yet it doesn’t seem like this barren land has anything else to offer. It’s not like their secrets matter anymore, they’re gone.;;
entering normal desert 4;You sigh as you watch through the window. There is no doubt anymore that you are in a desert. Somehow you were still hoping maybe it would be a very long beach. The air is thick, the view empty, aside from an occasional oasis. You feel like it won’t be long before you hear the first passenger complaints about the heat.;;
entering normal desert 5;You've only been in the desert for a couple of hours but you can already see à bunch of vultures following your train. How dare these birds mistake you for a corpse ? Now it's personal.;;
entering normal mountain 1;You can hear the locomotive engine blowing as you climb higher and higher. The mountains and their eternal snows are in sight. For a few minutes, their majestic appearance leaves you speechless.;;You tell your passengers it’s time+D11 to “leaf” this forest. They don’t seem to get the joke. It’s probably for the best.
entering normal mountain 2;You've never been one to let yourself be impressed. But the mountain range you're plunging into is something else! Snowflakes are crashing down on the locomotive, carried by the winds. It's going to be one hell of a ride.;;
entering normal mountain 3;It's getting colder and colder. You know that some mountains can be welcoming, but not the ones you've reached. You advise the passengers to put on their coats, as the weather is not going to get any better.;;
entering normal mountain 4;The tracks you are on lead you into the mountains. You secretely thank the engineers of the World Railway Company for building all these tunnels. Going around these mountains would have been certain death with the Catastrophe on your tail. Snow begins to fall, the cold is setting in, but you're ready.;;
entering normal mountain 5;Hopefully, none of your passengers are afraid of heights, because the mountains you've just reached are some of the highest you've ever seen.  You can see a few villages here and there in the distance. Do they know about the Catastrophe, isolated as they are? Probably. Who wouldn't?;;
entering hunger 1;As you walk through the rows in the carriage, you can see the toll starvation has taken on your passengers. They won’t last long without food and neither will you. You need to find a solution quickly.;;
entering hunger 2;You hear a knock on your cabin door. As you open it, a young frail person faints into your arms. You can barely hear their voice as they sheepishly ask for rations. The food shortages are starting to wreak havoc, soon people will be eating each other. You need to act now.;;
entering hunger 3;You hear a strange noise in your cabin. It takes you a while to understand that it is not coming from the engine, but from your own body. You’re starving! Maybe you were too focused on the tracks to notice it, but your food supplies are really low. One more problem to solve.;;
entering thirst 1;You think about your home and what you’ve left behind...somehow you keep thinking about the sea...Well, about water more specifically. Then, it hits you: you’re thirsty. Really thirsty. The water supply is running dry. You need to find a place to refill soon.;;
entering thirst 2;You don't know what's worse, the shortage of drinking water or the passengers whining about it. For your own sake, you should try to ressupply soon.;;
entering thirst 3;You hear loud clamors coming from the passengers’ carriage. As you go to investigate, an angry crowd quickly surrounds you. The water supply is low and everyone is pointing fingers, blaming each other for their excessive consumption. This could turn into a bloodbath. You need to get them water.;;
entering lowmorale 1;Days are feeling longer and longer. Is there even a point in continuing? What if you get to the end and there is nothing? What would have been the point of this trip if not to prolong your agony? You chase away these dark thoughts, you could use a moral boost, and your passengers too.;;
entering lowmorale 2;Your passengers look completely defeated, like they've given up. You fear they will all abandon you at the next stop. You can't have that! You need help to fix the train, to get supplies. You need to find a way to boost morale, quickly!;;
entering lowmorale 3;Morale is low in the passenger carriage. The same people that cried tears of joy when they got aboard your train are now crying in hopelesness. It would be nice to cheer them up.;;
exiting forest 1;On this beautiful day you reach the edge of the forest. You’re relieved, but also, a bit melancholic. As weird as it sounds, you feel like you are going to miss this forest, its wildlife, its freshness. There weren’t any real forests like this where you lived. There used to be but, you never really got to see them.;;
exiting forest 2;As you get up from your seat in the pilot’s room, you take a look through the windshield and behold a most bewildering sight. It’s the edge of the forest! It feels like you have been there for years, the change of scenery will be welcome.;;
exiting forest 3;As you come back to the train engine from your daily inspection of the carriages, the autopilot emits a small warning sign. You’ve reached the edge of the forest. Hopefully the old lady in the 3rd row will stop complaining about seeing too many trees now. But you have the suspicious feeling she will soon find something else to complain about.;;
exiting forest 4;There! You are at the end! The end of the forest that is. The end of the tracks is still far away. So far away...You hear loud cracking noises behind you. A gigantic oak tree has fallen on the tracks. There is no going back. Well, there never was anyway.;;
exiting desert 1;You don’t like sand, it’s coarse and rough and it gets everywhere. So it rejoices you to see the end of the desert. What awaits you beyond is still unknown but you’re feeling weirdly optimistic. After all, it can't be worse, right? Right...?;;
exiting desert 2;Finally the desert is coming to an end. You can't imagine ever missing this place. And let's hope you never will.;;
exiting desert 3;You'reaching the end of the desert. The only good thing about this place is that you got a small potted cactus as a souvenir.;;
exiting desert 4;You got through the desert, hooray! You've also learned a valuable lesson, deserts suck.;;
exiting mountain 1;You can feel the train coming down, the weather is better and the air more breathable. You leave the mountains behind, at the mercy of the Catastrophe.;;
exiting mountain 2;The snow on the locomotive and wagons begins to melt. You're on your way out of the mountains.;;
exiting mountain 3;Finally, you leave the mountains behind. Your passengers can stop complaining about the cold, and you're a little closer to the end of the tracks.;;
exiting mountain 4;Ain't no mountain high enough to stop you and your train. You've made it through. Enjoy this small victory.;;
action getwater forest 1;Passengers set up buckets under the flora to catch the morning dew. Once filtered, it can be used to fill your drinking water tanks.;;
action getwater forest 2;Luckily, you stopped next to a small water stream. Passengers take the opportunity to collect drinking water and wash up...Hopefully in this order.;;
action getwater forest 3;There is a small lake near your stop. You send a couple passengers to collect water while you stay here to guard the train engine. You’ve done enough manual labor for a whole life.;;
action getwater desert 1;An oasis! And it's not a mirage! Time to fill back your drinking water tanks.;;
action getwater desert 2;One of your passengers has the brillant idea to collect water from the nearby cacti. It's not much, but it's always welcome.;;
action getwater desert 3;Several passengers explored the area around the camp and found an abandoned village. Luckily, the well was still full. Who wants water?;;
action getwater mountain 1;At the end in a steep path close to your camp, there's a waterfall. You send a few passengers to fetch water for the train's supplies.;;
action getwater mountain 2;Your passengers collect snow in buckets and melt it to turn it into drinking water. Rudimentary, but still good.;;
action getwater mountain 3;It's cold outside today, but not cold enough to snow . You take the opportunity to collect water from the rain that is currently falling.;;
action getfood forest 1;There is plenty of wildlife in the forest to hunt. A few passengers are heading out with rifles.;;
action getfood forest 2;Passengers are taking turns collecting wild berries in the bushes around your camp. Seems like you won’t run out of desserts anytime soon.;;
action getfood forest 3;Some passengers are going out to hunt for food. You feel like you’ll be more useful garding the train engine. They’ll be fine without you. Probably…;;
action getfood desert 1;There's more wildlife around here than you thought. Some of the passengers will be hunting mountain goats while you prepare the fire. Everyone could use a hot meal.;;
action getfood desert 2;The tracks you've stopped on are so high up, many eagles have made their nest just nearby. You take their eggs to replenish your food reserves. In any case, these poor chicks have already been devoured by the Catastrophe, so what does it matter?;;
action getfood desert 3;A group of passengers have left to collect food. They return with a few mountain goats. Their meat is far from the finest you've ever tasted, but it'll do.;;
action leave forest 1;The Catastrophe is catching up. Plus you’ve seen enough trees those past few days, it’s time to leave.;;
action leave forest 2;You tell your passengers it’s time to leaf this forest. They don’t seem to get the joke. It’s probably for the best.;;
action leave forest 3;As pleasant as the forest is, the Catastrophe is on your tail. Time to go.;;
action leave desert 1;The sun's scorching rays have hit you hard enough. We're off!;;
action leave desert 2;You are tired of cleaning sand out of your clothes and the train's machinery, let's pack up and go.;;
action leave desert 3;Sand is definitely the worst thing, let's leave!;;
action leave mountain 1;You have spend enough time around here to develop vertigo. Let's leave.;;
action leave mountain 2;From the top of the mountains you look behind you. You can see the Catastrophe approaching. You must go.;;
action leave mountain 3;Those mountains weren't the worst place you've ever been, but still, you don't want to stay here longer than needed.;;
